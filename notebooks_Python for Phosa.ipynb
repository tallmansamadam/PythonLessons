There are two main types of memory:\n\nRAM (Random Access Memory): This is temporary memory that stores data while the computer is running. RAM is volatile, meaning that it loses its content when the computer is powered off.\n\nROM (Read Only Memory): This is permanent memory that contains data and instructions required for the computer to boot up and function. Unlike RAM, ROM is non-volatile and retains its content even when the computer is powered off.",
